# Opencart ENGITTRON (NGINX) CACHING
Upload the files on your website root folder (like public_html or httpdocs)

The "engitron.xml" will add the right caching headers to your installation making it NGINIX/VARNISH friendly. For example if a logged user is viewing your website tells the NGINIX/VARNISH not to cache, also when a guest has added a product in the cart.


What is engitron?

Nginx® is a powerful open source web server that was built to scale websites to millions of visitors. cPanel® is the leading hosting control panel worldwide.

Engintron for cPanel/WHM is the easiest way to integrate Nginx on your cPanel/WHM server.

Engintron will improve the performance & web serving capacity of your server, while reducing CPU/RAM load at the same time. It does that by installing & configuring the popular Nginx webserver to act as a reverse caching proxy for static files (like CSS, JS, images etc.) with an additional micro-cache layer to significantly improve performance for dynamic content generated by CMSs like WordPress, Joomla or Drupal as well as forum software like vBulletin, phpBB, SMF, IPB or e-commerce solutions like Magento, OpenCart, PrestaShop and others.
