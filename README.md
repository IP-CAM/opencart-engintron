# Opencart Engintron (NGINX) CACHING
Upload the files on your website root folder (like public_html or httpdocs)
 
The "engintron.xml" will add the right caching headers to your installation making it Nginx / Varnish friendly. For example if a logged user is viewing your website tells the Nginx / Varnish not to cache, also when a guest has added a product in the cart.
