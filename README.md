# VQMOD:
Upload the files on your website root folder (like public_html , httpdocs or www)

# OCMOD:
Zip folder contains of "ocmod" and install it through opencart v2.0+

 
The "engintron.xml" file will add the right caching headers to your installation making it Nginx / Varnish friendly. 

For example if a logged user is viewing your website tells the Nginx / Varnish not to cache, also when a guest has added a product in the cart.
