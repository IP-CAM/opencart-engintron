# Opencart ENGITTRON (NGINX) CACHING
Upload the files on your website root folder (like public_html or httpdocs)

The "engitron.xml" will add the right caching headers to your installation making it NGINIX/VARNISH friendly. For example if a logged user is viewing your website tells the NGINIX/VARNISH not to cache, also when a guest has added a product in the cart.
